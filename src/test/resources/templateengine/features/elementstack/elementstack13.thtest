%OUTPUT
# ----------------------------------
# NOTE in some way we are duplicating output by having a "p" entry with stack:model and another without,
#      but this makes sense because ModelProcessors can completely change models, so as a result of executing
#      the stack:model this "p" could have been transformed into something completely different that should
#      be a part of the stack anyway. So this is OK.
